# Nano Banana 3D Product Viewer (Images multi-angle view | not actual 3D model) for e-commerce

Kaggle "Nano Banana" Hackathon by Google DeepMind: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/banana

This project helps to make multi-angle product images view for e-commerce websites based on Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana), which is a state-of-the-art image generation / editing model. It can make product multi-view from the given reference image(s) of the product and optional visual effects text descriptions (not necessary). Then using ready easy-to-use JavaScript code in this GitHub repository, you can integrate multi-angle product image viewer for your e-commerce website.

## How to use

1. Go to [Product Multi-View with Nano Banana](https://www.kaggle.com/code/armanzhalgasbayev/product-multi-view-with-nano-banana) Gemini AI Studio Application, where you can generate multi-angle product images using Nano Banana model. It will generate 6 images (left, right, top, bottom, front, back) based on your input image(s) and optional text description of visual effects. You can also use your own images generated by any other means. This application already has pre-defined prompts to generate high-quality studio product images.

6. To integrate multi-angle product image viewer for your e-commerce website, copy the code from [index.html](index.html) file and paste it into your website's HTML file. Then replace the image URLs in the code with your own generated image URLs or just replace files in "images" folder with your own images keeping the same file names (back.png, front.png, left.png, right.png, top.png, bottom.png).

7. Enjoy your multi-angle product image viewer on your e-commerce website!

# My observations

- The best commercial use-case for Multi-View using Nano Banana is in the industry of cars, furniture, fashion (clothes, shoes, bags, accessories), electronics (phones, laptops, cameras), home decor (lamps, vases, clocks), toys & collectibles. These industries often require detailed product views from multiple angles to help customers make informed purchasing decisions. Taking multiple photos of products from different angles can be time-consuming and expensive. Nano Banana can generate high-quality multi-view images quickly and cost-effectively, making it an attractive option for businesses looking to improve their product listings.
- Especially car industry can benefit a lot from this technology, as cars have complex shapes and details that are difficult to capture in a single image. Multi-view images can help customers see the car from all angles, including the interior and exterior, which can be especially important for online car sales, saving time and money for car dealerships. Experimentally, I observed that car images generated by Nano Banana are of very high quality and look very realistic. Examples:

- The quality of the generated images can vary depending on the input image(s) and the text description provided. It may take some experimentation to find the best prompts and settings for your specific use case.
