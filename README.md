# Nano Banana 3D Product Viewer (Images multi-angle view | not actual 3D model) for e-commerce

Kaggle "Nano Banana" Hackathon by Google DeepMind: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/banana

This project helps to make multi-angle product images view for e-commerce websites based on Google Gemini Flash 2.5 (Nano Banana), which is a state-of-the-art image generation / editing model. It can make product multi-view from the given reference image(s) of the product and optional visual effects text descriptions (not necessary). Then using ready easy-to-use JavaScript code in this GitHub repository, you can integrate multi-angle product image viewer for your e-commerce website.

## How to use

1. Go to [Product Multi-View with Nano Banana](https://www.kaggle.com/code/armanzhalgasbayev/product-multi-view-with-nano-banana) Gemini AI Studio Application, where you can generate multi-angle product images using Nano Banana model. It will generate 6 images (left, right, top, bottom, front, back) based on your input image(s) and optional text description of visual effects. You can also use your own images generated by any other means. This application already has pre-defined prompts to generate high-quality studio product images.

6. To integrate multi-angle product image viewer for your e-commerce website, copy the code from [index.html](index.html) file and paste it into your website's HTML file. Then replace the image URLs in the code with your own generated image URLs or just replace files in "images" folder with your own images keeping the same file names (back.png, front.png, left.png, right.png, top.png, bottom.png).

7. Enjoy your multi-angle product image viewer on your e-commerce website! Demo: [Product Multi-View with Nano Banana](#)
